**Tech Stack :**

2. Backend : Node.js

**Why This Project :**

- Iâ€™ve chosen this project because it addresses a real-world problem in the fashion industry, especially for aspiring fashion designers and customers looking for unique, custom-made clothing. With more students studying fashion design, many struggle to find job opportunities or showcase their creativity. This platform provides a valuable solution by connecting these emerging designers directly with customers, giving them a chance to build their careers and gain exposure.
- From the customers' perspective, the platform allows them to easily communicate their specific fashion requirements and collaborate on custom designs, moving away from the limited options of premade clothing.
